# OS_Project
Project to complete the course "Operating Systems".

This project consisted in comparing two process scheduling algorithms and two page replacement algorithms. As process scheduling algorithms I chose: FCFS (First Come First Serve) and SJF (Shortest Job First), and as page replacement algorithms: FIFO (First In First Out) and LRU (Least Recently Used). Then, for the process scheduling algorithms, I calculated the average execution times for 10,100,1000 processes with random data, and for the page replacement algorithms, I calculated the number of necessary replacements for random 50 and 100 pages. The results can be found in the report.
